#### [Whoâ€™s homeless enough for housing? In San Francisco, an algorithm decides](https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/san-francisco-homeless-algorithm/)

#### Article Synopsis

An algorithm was originally developed as a way for social service providers to assess the sitiuation and needs of clients so they could make a more informed decisions about what type of housing assistance specific clients would need. The alogorithm weighs different factors ralted to mental health, physical health and risk factors (example: drug or sexual abuse) and provides a score to help case managers guide each person towards appropriate resources.

However, cities have not been using the output score of the algorithm as a guide, but rather the determining factor as to whether or not someone will receive housing. Receiving a score below a certain threshhold will result in a denial of housing assistance.

Other issues are that it is unclear how the algorithm is wieghted, so it is unclear which factors have a larger impact on the overall score. This is said to avoid case workers trying to "game" the algorithm, but also creates a black box situation which make it difficult to determine the effectiveness of the algorithm. 

Several who have gone through the process of answering the questions used in the algorithm have found some of the questions to be too personal and in some casing triggering about past trauma (having to explain instances of sexual assault, domestic violence or suicidal ideation).

Those who do not qualify are no given any assistance to find permanant housing and most wind up back on the street waiting until they are eligable to try again. The results are also not in favor of helping. Only 17% of over 18000 single adults assessed in a 2 1/2 year period resulted in people moving into a new home.
